Project Checkin

This project comes from a really simple concept:

An anonymous user, can checkin to something, anything, every day. Whether the person made a New Year's resolution to excersise daily, or whether he/she vows to quit a bad habit like drinking or smoking, or for whatever reason the user want to come to the same place every day, this website can help. The user can checkin to his own task, or if he wants to do something with a group (like AA), it will be equally easy.

Not registration or login will be required. A person or a group can create a new task on the website just by clicking a button, providing an optional name/description if the user so desires, and a unique URL will be generated. The user can come to the URL every day, and the webpage will display his/her track record on a calendar.

Checking in is as simple as clicking a day on the calendar, and the user may also want to leave or modify a comment. He could share the URL if he wishes to share he jouney with others, and if he's part of a group task, every member can see how every other member is holding up. The website will optionally sent email or text reminders if the user requests such services.

The idea behind this project is to get some hands on experience building a scalable service utilizing more modern web technologies.

My plan is to start by defining the scope of this project with a specific set of user cases, and then evolve my design and until a complete website is up and running. From my current understanding, this project is not particularly difficult to complete, and it has a nice mixture of frontend and backend tasks.

Of course, the services will be provided for free. If there is more traffic load than I anticipated, perhaps I'll have to put on some ads so I don't go broke. Also, depending on whether a suitable domain is available, the name of the project may change in the future.
