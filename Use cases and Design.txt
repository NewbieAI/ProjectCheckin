The website will support the following features:

1. User can visit the main website, which contains instructions on what the website does

2. User can create a personal task, public or private
   - Server creates a unique URL, and stores a corresponding calendar object, which is a data container
      for all the checkin activities and comments

3. User can create a group task, or join a group task.
   - Server creates a unique URL for the group task, and webpage stores all the members that are       participating.
   - With every entry into the group task, a new calendar object is created

4. User to delete his task at any time. Group task expires when the last member activity happened 180 days ago.

4. User can browse popular ongoing tasks, or search for tasks in the search bar

5. Access control
   - User can make his task public or private. Private task requires a key to access the content of the           calendar object. Only task owner can do the check in, owner has an owner key. Everyone with access      can leave a coment.
   - Group projects can be public or private, anyone can join a public group task, but private groups             require a key to join.
   - This is no privacy within groups, all members can see all activities.
   - User can change his owner key or private task key for whatever reason.

6. User profile
   - Only tasks are stored, the website does not store user profile.
   - User can divulge as much or as little personal information in his task description, and the website      (aka me), will not care about who is using the service or why.


The website MAY support the following features if I have to time to build them:

1. Comments may contain emoji or multimedia, in case user wants to showcase his/her achievements.

2. Developer API may be provided at some point, not that I anticipate people using it, but it's nice to know how to provide them so may end up providing it.

3. Report for abuse. If user puts copyrighted material on his/her calendar, or posts pornagraphic, violent, illegal, or otherwise inappropriate contents on my website, I could get into trouble. Nah, I don't want to get into trouble.

The website will NOT support the following features:

1. Instant messaging, friending and blacklisting. Anyone interested in these features can go use     Facebook.

2. Task recommendation. Again, I do not want to collect user specific information and have always hated "customized" services that all the big websites have forced onto me. So no, none of that.
